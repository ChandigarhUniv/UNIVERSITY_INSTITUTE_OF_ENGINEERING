## COURSE OBJECTIVE
The primary goal of this course is to teach students the basic principles of computer control and automation of engineering systems and processes. Students obtain the following competences: basic control principles and general methods of systems’ design and assembly, approach to control systems as a product (from the aspect of key attributes like, for example, purpose, function, mechanism and structure), a life-cycle aspect to control systems and use of non-engineering aspects of control, systems use knowledge of basic methods, tools and elements necessary for control-system design like: mathematical modeling and computer simulation, various methods for control design and implementation of control functions, computer-aided control-system design, sensors, actuators, and supervisory-control software. 

1. To understand the importance of advanced controllers and compensating networks along with their design.  
2. A dvanced techniques for solving complex control problems.  
3. To study the theory and methodology for analysis, modelling of systems and signals. 
4. To understand the methods for design and synthesis of feedback controllers. 

## COURSE OUTCOMES
1. Illustrate the measurement mechanism of transfer function
2. Model time response of first and second order control systems using standard test signals.
3. xamine frequency domain analysis of linear control system
4. Evaluate stability of systems in time/frequency domain using different techniques.
5. Designs lead and lag compensation networks for given specifications.

## Course Type: Department Elective

> (B.E. Mechatronics Engineering)

Design of control systems for practical applications requires a thorough understanding of physical models of the process, mathematical modeling techniques, and transient behavior of systems and dynamic characteristics of a physical system. Introduction to linear spaces and operators; mathematical description input/output systems; state variables and state transition matrix; controllability and observability and its application to irreducible realization of transfer function matrices; state variable estimation; controller syntheses by state feedback; stability of linear systems; analysis of composite systems. A study of nonlinearities in control systems, phase plane analysis, isoclines, equilibrium points, limit cycles, optimum systems; heuristic methods; harmonic balance, describing function, frequency response and jump phenomena. Oscillations in relay systems, state space, optimum relay controls, stability, and Liapunov’s method are also covered.
