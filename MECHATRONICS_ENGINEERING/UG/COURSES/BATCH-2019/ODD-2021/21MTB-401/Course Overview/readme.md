## COURSE OBJECTIVE
The primary goal of this course is to teach students the basic principles of computer control and automation of engineering systems and processes. Students obtain the following competences: basic control principles and general methods of systems’ design and assembly, approach to control systems as a product (from the aspect of key attributes like, for example, purpose, function, mechanism and structure), a life-cycle aspect to control systems and use of non-engineering aspects of control, systems use knowledge of basic methods, tools and elements necessary for control-system design like: mathematical modeling and computer simulation, various methods for control design and implementation of control functions, computer-aided control-system design, sensors, actuators, and supervisory-control software. 

1. To understand the importance of advanced controllers and compensating networks along with their design.  
2. A dvanced techniques for solving complex control problems.  
3. To study the theory and methodology for analysis, modelling of systems and signals. 
4. To understand the methods for design and synthesis of feedback controllers. 

## COURSE OUTCOMES
1. Illustrate the measurement mechanism of transfer function
2. Model time response of first and second order control systems using standard test signals.
3. xamine frequency domain analysis of linear control system
4. Evaluate stability of systems in time/frequency domain using different techniques.
5. Designs lead and lag compensation networks for given specifications.

## Course Type: Department Elective

> (B.E. Mechatronics Engineering)

Design of control systems for practical applications requires a thorough understanding of physical models of the process, mathematical modeling techniques, and transient behavior of systems and dynamic characteristics of a physical system. Introduction to linear spaces and operators; mathematical description input/output systems; state variables and state transition matrix; controllability and observability and its application to irreducible realization of transfer function matrices; state variable estimation; controller syntheses by state feedback; stability of linear systems; analysis of composite systems. A study of nonlinearities in control systems, phase plane analysis, isoclines, equilibrium points, limit cycles, optimum systems; heuristic methods; harmonic balance, describing function, frequency response and jump phenomena. Oscillations in relay systems, state space, optimum relay controls, stability, and Liapunov’s method are also covered. 

> To begin, I recommend taking a few minutes to explore the [course site](https://cuchd.blackboard.com/ultra/courses/_35887_1). Review the material we’ll cover each week, and preview the assignments you’ll need to complete to qualify the course. Click Discussion Tasks to see forums where you can discuss the course material with me and the fellow students. If you have questions about course content, please post them in the forums to get help from others in the course community. Lecture topics will be discussed in the sessions. Good luck as you get started, and I hope you enjoy the course!

## Netiquette Guidelines

Netiquette is an etiquette for the internet, guidelines, and good practices for online communication in emails, discussion forums, and chat rooms. Please practice the following guidelines when posting comments in the course:

- Format your text so it is easy to read. Try to use standard paragraph spacing, indentation, and legible font. Try to be consistent with your formatting, including font size, color, etc.

- Be concise and to the point in your communication. Limit discussion forum posts to a few paragraphs. Proofread and edit your work before posting.

- AVOID THE USE OF ALL CAPS as this may be interpreted as shouting. All lowercase letters also make the text more difficult to read. Use standard punctuation. Remember what your teacher taught you in primary school about good punctuation and spelling.

- Avoid 'texting' abbreviations such as OMG.

- Avoid using humor and sarcasm, as they are often difficult to detect in written communication. It is okay to sparingly use emoticons to communicate subtleties of emotions that are more obvious in spoken communication.

- Flaming is not proper in our courses (a rant about someone or some topic). Practice civil discussion.

- Respect the privacy of communication within a course. Do not publicly forward the comments of classmates to others outside of the course.

- Stay on topic in a discussion.

- Be respectful. Participants have varying degrees of sensitivity, and that even some well-meaning constructive suggestions (e.g., comments about broken links, typos, misspellings) may be misconstrued as public criticism. Therefore, please refrain from sharing comments in ways that might be misinterpreted, or do so privately when appropriate.

> (Any violation to the above points if reported by the teacher may lead to disciplinary action against the student)
